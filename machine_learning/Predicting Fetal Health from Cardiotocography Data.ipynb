    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### What is CTG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiotocography (CTG) is a technique used during pregnancy to visually represent the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. The main purpose of this kind of monitoring is to asses the fetal health in late pregnancy and during labour and to allow detection of fetal distress.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the consensus guidelines made by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) the basic CTG features include baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations and contractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Baseline_ is the average heart rate of the fetus within a ten minute window. A value in the range of 110-160 beats per minute (bpm) is considered to be normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Variability_ is the variation of fetal heart rate from beat to beat. It is determined by irregular fluctuations in amplitude and frequency in the baseline. A value of 5-25 bpm is normal and indicates an intact neurological system in the fetus.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Acceleration_ refers to abrupt increase in fetal heart rate that peaks at 15 bpm or more above the baseline and lasts 15 seconds or longer. Most accelerations coincide with fetal movement and uterine contractions, which indicates a healthy fetus.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Deceleration_ is the abrupt decrease in fetal heart rate of more than 15 bpm below the baseline for more than 15 seconds. There are early, variable, late and prolonged decelerations. Early decelerations start when the uterine contraction begins and end when it stops. Variable decelerations have a variable recovery phase and may not be linked to uterine contractions. These first two types are not considered pathological. Late decelerations start at the peak of the uterine contraction and recover after the contraction ends. They indicate insufficient blood flow to the uterus and placenta which leads to significantly reduced blood flow to the fetus as well. Prolonged decelerations last for more than 3 minutes and are frequently associated with accute fetal stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Contractions_ are bell-shaped gradual increases in the uterine activity signal followed by roughly symmetric decreases, lasting 45−120 seconds in total. Five or fewer contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window are considered normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How is CTG data analysed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of CTG data is usually done by experienced professionals according to the standardized FIGO guidelines. An automated way to analyse the data is a program called SisPorto developed in the late 1980s at the University of Porto. This type of computerized analysis is based on the same guidelines but includes additional computations of the main features outlined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluation of the basic CTG features the fetal condition is classified as one of three classes - normal, suspicious or parhological.\n",
    "\n",
    " - _Normal_: This condition is characterized with a baseline of 110-160 bpm, variability of 5-25 bpm and no repetitive decelerations. It indicates a fetus with no hypoxia or acidosis and requires no intervention to improve fetal oxygenation state.\n",
    " - _Suspicious_: This condition is lacking at least one characteristic of normality but has no pathological features. It indicates a fetus with a low probability of having hypoxia or acidosis and requires close monitoring or additional methods to evaluate fetal oxygenation.\n",
    " - _Pathological_: This condition is characterized with a baseline of below 100 bpm, reduced or increased variability, or sinusoidal pattern and repetitive late or prolonged decelerations for more than 20-30 min if variability is reduced, or one prolonged deceleration with duration of more than 5 min. It indicates a fetus with a high probability of having hypoxia or acidosis and requires immediate action to correct reversible causes, as well as additional methods to evaluate fetal oxygenation or expedite delivery if this is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different classification models in the prediction of one of the three classes described above. Those models will be trained on data obtained from the SisPorto program and use labels classified by three expert obstetricians."

    "A couple of classification algorithms were tested for the prediction of fetal health from available data of CTG features. All of them performed rather high, but the best one of those algorithms proved to be the random forest classifier which can identify with 94% certainty the correct fetal condition, as classified by professionals in the field.\n",
